# Project Template Explanation

This is to explain what each part of the project template is. Any items in the other included files that are **bolded** (with \*\*around\*\* in the markdown) it needs to be modified before it should be used. Please remove this file from the repository once it is set up. 

**[README.md](README.md)** - This is the first thing someone will see when they open up the project. It should give a description of what the project is, how to get started using it, and link to the other documents (CONTRIBUTING.md, DESIGN.md, and the LICENSE.md).

**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - This document explains how to contribute code to the project. It should point to what things need to be done, how to submit code, how to report bugs, and style guidelines. 

**[LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)** - This document describes what Open Source License the project uses. Check out this [site][Choose License] for information about different licenses. This file will be generated by Github and differ from project to project, so it is not included here.

**[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)** - This document describes the architecure of the project. It should provide both a brief description of the entire project and a more in depth guide for each component. It's goal is to help anyone new to the project understand how it works. 

**[.gitignore](.gitignore)** - This file tells Git to ignore the specified files. These files will not be pushed to any repository. 

**[.editorconfig](.editorconfig)** - This file helps configure certain aspects of your editor to be inline with the project's guidelines. Your editor needs to support it in order to work, so check out this [website][EditorConfig] for installing a plugin to support it.
